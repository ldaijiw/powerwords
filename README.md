## POWER WORDS

(List of Power Words)[https://sumo.com/stories/power-words]

Hi my name is Leo Waltmann, I've recently graduated from Imperial College London with a degree in physics.
Although my primary experience was with python working on data analysis and visualisation projects,
I've had a variety of work experience from completing an internship at the Educational Technology Department at Imperial to even working as a waiter and barman at a fast paced restaurant in central London.
Throughout all of these experiences I've realised I'm always trying to work out more efficient ways to complete tasks, and find ways to automate processes that don't need to be done manually.
and the variety has helped me find ways to communicate and work with anyone.
Particularly during my internship I wrote a script to automate a process for teaching staff to reduce the time from potentially 30 minutes down to just 1.
The philosophy, mindset, and principles of DevOps resonated with me.
I feel DevOps is the perfect path for me to follow as I can quickly pick up the necessary skills and then find ways to maximise efficiency and profits even further.
