## POWER WORDS

[List of Power Words](https://sumo.com/stories/power-words)

Hi my name is Leo Waltmann, I've recently completed a challenging degree in physics at Imperial College London.

Although my primary experience was with python working on interesting data analysis and visualisation projects,
I've had a variety of work experience from completing an internship at the Educational Technology Department at Imperial to even working as a waiter and barman at a fast paced restaurant in central London.
Throughout all of these enlightening experiences I've realised I'm always trying to work out more efficient ways to complete tasks, and find methods to automate complicated processes that don't need to be done manually, and the variety has helped me find ways to improve my my communication skills and work with anyone.
Particularly during my internship I successfully wrote a script to automate a process for teaching staff to drastically reduce the time from potentially 30 minutes down to just 1.
The philosophy, mindset, and principles of DevOps really resonated with me. The idea of continuous integration and delivery is fascinating to me and feels very intuitive as a method for software development. 
I feel DevOps is the perfect path for me to follow as I can quickly pick up the necessary skills and then find ways to maximise efficiency and profits even further.
